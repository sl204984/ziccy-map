THIS FILE WILL INSTRUCT THE WEBMAP DEPLOYMENT AS FOLLOW.

Before deploying the webmap source code, you should make them compressed and 
hard to read. In the step, some tools will be used.
1. node.js
2. npm
3. gulp
You could configure the environment with gulp-install.sh running.
If you got all of them, run 'gulp mjs' and 'gulp mcss' in webmap directory.
Then you will get tkmap.min.js & tkmap.min.css at the 'minified' sub directory.
Copy these two files; they will act as the tkmap sdk.
